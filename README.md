# Cleaning data in MySQL

In this MySQL project, I cleaned the dataset to enhance usability. 
Identified inconsistencies, errors, and redundancies were fixed, improving data integrity. All of the cleaning work was done using MySQL functions. 
Refer to the MySQL V1 file in this repository to see the queries that I used. 

Thank you for your time

Best!
Luis
